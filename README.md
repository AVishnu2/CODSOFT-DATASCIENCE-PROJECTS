Introduction

Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In the first task, I explored the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, I aimed to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction
Task 2 involved predicting movie ratings, a fascinating challenge that allowed me to dive into recommendation systems. Through data preprocessing and model building, I aimed to create a predictive model for movie ratings.

Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
The final task revolved around Credit Card Fraud Detection, a critical application of machine learning in finance. I implemented models to identify fraudulent transactions, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance financial security.

Conclusion :

The Codsoft Data Science Internship has been an enriching experience, providing me with the skills and knowledge to tackle real-world data challenges. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects and look forward to applying these skills in future endeavors.
